This repository contains the periphery smart contracts for the Uniswap V3 Protocol.
For the lower level core contracts, see the [uniswap-v3-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core)
repository.

## Local deployment

In order to deploy this code to a local testnet, you should install the npm package
`@uniswap/v3-periphery`
and import bytecode imported from artifacts located at
`@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/contracts/*/*.json`.
For example:

```typescript
import {
  abi as SWAP_ROUTER_ABI,
  bytecode as SWAP_ROUTER_BYTECODE,
} from '@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/contracts/SwapRouter.sol/SwapRouter.json'

// deploy the bytecode
```

This will ensure that you are testing against the same bytecode that is deployed to
mainnet and public testnets, and all Uniswap code will correctly interoperate with
your local deployment.
